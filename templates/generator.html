            <h3 id ="subhead">Methods</h3>
            <p>In this portion of our project, we used pre-existing machine learning models to predict the age and gender of a given facial image. The method we used was from a project that used convolutional neural networks to train a model in a Caffe framework by Gil Levi and Tal Hassner<a href="#references"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
            <h3 id ="subhead">Dataset</h3>
            <p>The project used a dataset from the Adience Benchmark dataset for gender and age classification<a href="#references"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. The dataset comprised of 26,580 images (2gb) of 2,284 subjects. The images were taken from real-world imaging conditions. The images included distortions such as low-resolution or blurry images.</p>

            <p>The method used a network architecture comprised of three convolutional neural networks with two fully-connected layers. The method was implemented using the Caffe open-source framework, developed by Berkeley AI Research.</p>

            <p>The training for the model was performed on an Amazon GPU machine with 1,536 CUDA cores and 4GB of video memory. Training each network required about 4 hours.</p>

            <p>Table 2 and Table 3 from Levi and Hassner’s paper show the accuracy results from the gender and age classification using their trained models. For age classification, accuracy is measured when the algorithm gives the exact age as well as when the algorithm is off by one adjacent age-group (one age group older or younger).</p>

            <hr id="underline">
            <p>We gathered a group of images for each age and gender groups from the Adience dataset and cropped and flipped the images for testing. We ran the images into both the Caffe and TensorFlow models with the results shown below. The green shade represents correct predictions, yellow shade represents predictions off by one age group, and the red shade represents incorrect predictions with the age group being off by more than one.</p>
            <img id="imgContent" src="../static/images/prediction-results.png" alt="Prediction Results">
            <p>Overall, the predictions for gender were more accurate, and the age predictions were mostly at least one age group away from the correct age group. Interestingly, the TensorFlow version performed slightly better at predicting the age groups than the Caffe model.</p>

            <p>By looking through the dataset images, we found that some images included motion blur, distortions, or exposure issues that may not be ideal for model training. The characteristics of real-world images such as images found on online photo repositories or social media sites may bring challenges in age and gender identification.</p>
            <p>It was impressive to see that relatively high accuracy for age and gender classification can result from a small dataset and a simple CNN network. It would be interesting to see if using a more sophisticated CNN network and a larger dataset would improve prediction results.</p>
            <p>OpenCV is difficult to install on a Mac, but it has some useful facial recognition system built-in that helped with cropping and placing text onto the image.</p>
